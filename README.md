# Easy_Beautful__Cal_WebSite
I've developed a calculator app, complete with responsive design and polished styling. The app is hosted on my GitHub repository, showcasing its functionality and aesthetics. With a user-friendly interface and seamless responsiveness across various devices, it's highly recommended for practical use. 


Steps I followed In my WebSite

Certainly! Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the process involved in creating and modifying the calculator app:

Initial Setup:

1)Created a new HTML file (index.html) to serve as the landing page for the calculator app.
Included a basic structure with <head> and <body> tags.
Linked an external CSS file (style.css) to apply styles to the HTML elements.
Styling the Landing Page:

2)Applied CSS styles to the body to set the background image and add animation (bg1.png, bg2.png).
Used Flexbox to center the content vertically and horizontally within the viewport.
Added a container <div> to hold the welcome message and link to the calculator.
Styled the heading (<h1>) and link (<a>) elements for better visibility and interaction.
Creating the Calculator Page:

3)Developed a separate HTML file (calculator.html) to build the calculator interface.
Designed the layout using a <div> with the class .Calculator to contain the calculator buttons.
Included an <input> field to display the calculation result.
Added buttons (<button>) for digits, operators, clear, delete, and equal sign (=).
Implementing Calculator Functionality:

4)Wrote JavaScript functions to handle user input and perform calculations (script.js).
Implemented functions to display numbers and operators in the input field.
Utilized the eval() function to evaluate mathematical expressions and display the result.
Implemented functions to clear the input field (Clear()) and delete the last character (del()).
Enhancing Styling and Animations:

5)Added additional CSS styles to refine the appearance of the calculator buttons and input field.
Applied box-shadow effects and border-radius for a more polished look.
Improved button hover effects for better user feedback.
Applied animation (flowBackground) to the calculator page's background image to create a dynamic visual effect.
Final Touches and Testing:

6)Fine-tuned the styling and functionality to ensure a seamless user experience.
Tested the app across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
Made adjustments based on feedback and testing results to address any issues or improvements needed.
